# What is this?

I'm looking to start learning Rust a little, and ran across [this Reddid post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3g0k1q/small_projects_to_learn_rust/cttq68w).

In essence, the requirements are:

- Count the number of primes up to limit N
- Find the largest prime up to limit N
- Find the list of primes up to limit N
- Pass in N as a command line argument
- Write an eratosthenes(limit N) function in a library
- Profile code for speed
- Write odds-only version
- Write 2357wheel ([info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_factorization))
