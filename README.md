# What is this?

I'm looking to start learning Rust a little, and ran across [this Reddid post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3g0k1q/small_projects_to_learn_rust/cttq68w).

In essence, the requirements are:

- [x] Count the number of primes up to limit N
- [x] Find the largest prime up to limit N
- [x] Find the list of primes up to limit N
- [x] Pass in N as a command line argument
- [x] Write an eratosthenes(limit N) function in a library
- [ ] Profile code for speed
- [ ] Write odds-only version
- [ ] Write 2357wheel ([info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_factorization))
